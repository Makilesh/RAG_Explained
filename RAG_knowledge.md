Advanced RAG Techniques 🎯
1. Hierarchical RAG

First find relevant documents, then find relevant chunks

Better for large document collections

### 2. Conversational RAG
- Remember conversation history
- Ask clarifying questions
- Maintain context across multiple questions

### 3. Multi-Modal RAG
- Include images, charts, and tables
- Extract text from images with OCR
- Handle structured data like spreadsheets

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Do I need expensive hardware or cloud services?**
- **A:** No! This tutorial is designed to run on regular laptops. We use lightweight models that work on CPU.

**Q: How much Python knowledge do I need?**
- **A:** Basic Python is helpful, but we explain everything step by step. If you can run a Python script, you're good to go!

**Q: Can I use this for commercial projects?**
- **A:** Yes! The MIT license allows commercial use. Just be aware of the licenses of the models you use.

**Q: Is this better than ChatGPT?**
- **A:** Different! ChatGPT is more general, but RAG can answer questions about YOUR specific documents and data.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why do we chunk documents?**
- **A:** Language models have limits on how much text they can process at once. Chunking also improves retrieval precision.

**Q: What's the difference between embeddings and keywords?**
- **A:** Keywords look for exact matches. Embeddings understand meaning, so "car" and "vehicle" are treated as similar.

**Q: Can I use different language models?**
- **A:** Absolutely! You can swap in GPT-4, Claude, or any other model. Just change the generator component.

**Q: How do I handle different languages?**
- **A:** Use multilingual embedding models like "paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2" and ensure your generator supports your target language.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: I get "CUDA out of memory" errors. What do I do?**
- **A:** Use the CPU versions of libraries (faiss-cpu) and set device="cpu" in your models.

**Q: My answers are not relevant. How do I fix this?**
- **A:** Try smaller chunk sizes, check your similarity scores, and make sure your documents contain the information you're asking about.

**Q: The system is very slow. Any tips?**
- **A:** Use smaller models, process documents in batches, and consider using a proper vector database like ChromaDB for large collections.

**Q: Can I add new documents without reprocessing everything?**
- **A:** Yes! Just call `add_knowledge()` again with new content. The system will add to the existing knowledge base.

### Advanced Questions

**Q: How do I evaluate RAG performance?**
- **A:** Create test question-answer pairs and measure accuracy, relevance, and completeness. See our evaluation exercise above.

**Q: Can I combine RAG with fine-tuned models?**
- **A:** Yes! RAG retrieves information, fine-tuning teaches style and behavior. They complement each other well.

**Q: How do I handle contradictory information in documents?**
- **A:** Advanced RAG systems can detect and flag conflicts. For now, prioritize by source quality and recency.

**Q: What about privacy and security?**
- **A:** RAG runs locally with your documents. For sensitive data, avoid cloud-based models and use local alternatives.

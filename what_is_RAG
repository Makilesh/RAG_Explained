RAG involves three steps namely: Retrieval, Augmentation and Generation.

Retrieval - In this step, the system searches an external knowledge source, such as a vector database to find relevant information based on the user query.

Augmentation - The retrieved information is then combined with the original user query to get the LLM prompt.

Generation - The LLM processes the prompt and generates a response, integrating both its pre-trained knowledge and the retrieved information. This results in more accurate and contextually relevant responses.


## How RAG Works: The Big Picture

RAG has five main steps:

Document Ingestion: Load your documents (e.g., text files, PDFs) into a system.

Embedding Creation: Convert documents into numerical "fingerprints" (embeddings) that capture their meaning.

Retrieval: Search for the most relevant documents based on a user’s question.

Augmentation: Combine the user’s question with the retrieved documents.

Generation: Use a language model to create a clear, accurate answer.


## Why is RAG Important?

Accuracy: It pulls real facts from documents, reducing errors.

Flexibility: You can use it with any set of documents (e.g., your notes, articles, or manuals).

Power: It combines the smarts of AI language models with the reliability of external data.

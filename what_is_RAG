Retrival-Augmentation Generation aka RAG is like giving a chatbot an open textbook during an exam. Instead of relying only on memorized knowledge which it was trained on, it can look up current, accurate information before answering your questions.

RAG enhances LLM responses by retrieving information from vector databases or external knowledge sources, then using that context to generate accurate, up-to-date responses.


RAG involves three steps namely: Retrieval, Augmentation and Generation.

Retrieval - Finds relevant information from an external knowledge source based on the user's query

Augmentation - The retrieved information is now combined with the original user query and is now set as the LLM prompt

Generation - The LLM now processes the prompt and generates a response which is more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## How RAG Works: The Big Picture

RAG has five main steps:

Document Ingestion: Load your documents (e.g., text files, PDFs) into a system.


Embedding Creation: Convert documents into numerical "fingerprints" (embeddings) that capture their meaning.

Retrieval: Search for the most relevant documents based on a user’s question.

Augmentation: Combine the user’s question with the retrieved documents.

Generation: Use a language model to create a clear, accurate answer.


## Why is RAG Important?

Accuracy: It pulls real facts from documents, reducing errors.

Flexibility: You can use it with any set of documents (e.g., your notes, articles, or manuals).

Power: It combines the smarts of AI language models with the reliability of external data.
